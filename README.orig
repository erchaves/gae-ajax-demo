This is not a real project.  It's basically just a sample to practice setting up google app engine. 

My goal here is basically to figure out the best way to setup a default GAE project with ajax tools.  This isn't quite right yet.  I'm trying to look into task queues and the URL fetch APIs to see if that's what I'm looking for...
Right now I'm resorting to ajax polling which is pretty lame, and my request handlers are still reloading the page when I don't want them to.

Meanwhile, I found this youtube video from a recent google conference talk -

It looks like Google is going to release the "channel" API soon that will solve some of these things..
